==What Already Exists?==

  * Core API for the web testing framework
  The basic core APIs are complete for basic HTTP-based automated testing. All testing is context-driven, such that the web context is maintained by the context handler. Cookies are maintained between requests in the same test.
  * Validation and Extraction rules
  * Web test driver executable
  * HTTP web request support for GET, HEAD, and POST requests

==What Is Planned?==

  * XST for Test List file
  * Nested Test Lists
  * Better command-line testing with test driver
  * More request types
  * More generic response handling
  * More built-in validation and extraction rules
  * Some level of support for !JavaScript
  * External IDE for automated testing
  * Visual Studio 2010 and !SharpDevelop plug-ins to automate testing inside of an IDE environment
